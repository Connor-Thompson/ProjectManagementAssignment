<h2> Project Managment Assignment </h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my first project management project. In this repository you can find everything to do with the corrisponding project that I have been working on as part of my BTEC national Extended Diploma. Here is everything you need to know:</p>

<h2>The Project Management Scenario: </h2>
<p>You have recently been recruited by a new software development company as a trainee project manager. You have been asked to manage your first software development project</p>

<h2>The Software Project Scenario: </h2>
<p>The director of the company is interested in investigating if the company could make use of IoT technologies in its products and services and your manager has asked you to develop a prototype system which uses this technology.

The problem that the directors are keen to solve is that their current control systems simply set off an alarm when they detect values outside a pre-set range.

They would like to provide systems that offer remote monitoring and management of the environment by the user.

Task:
Following your investigation into IoT technologies your manager has asked you to design and create a prototype system which solves the problem with the companyâ€™s current alarm systems. The prototype will, using a Raspberry Pi or similar microcomputer, detect temperature changes, provide them to the the user in real time and in data sets, and control environmental control systems to ensure the environment is stable.</p>
